## Mathemetics Basics:

### modulo

modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, the expression 26 % 5 would return 1, because 26 divided by 5 is 5 with a remainder of 1.

So in your example, 5 modulo 26 would also return 5, because 5 cannot be divided by 26 evenly, and the remainder is 5. Therefore, the expression 5 % 26 would evaluate to 5.


## Computer Architecture and Memory

### Padding

Padding, also known as alignment, is the insertion of extra bytes of memory between data elements in a data structure in order to satisfy the alignment requirements of the CPU architecture. CPU architectures have different alignment requirements, which specify how data must be stored in memory so that it can be accessed efficiently by the CPU.

For example, on a 32-bit architecture, 32-bit integers must be aligned on a 4-byte boundary, while on a 64-bit architecture, 64-bit integers must be aligned on an 8-byte boundary. If data is not properly aligned, it can cause performance issues or even result in a crash.

Consider the following struct in C++:


struct Example {
    char c;
    int i;
    double d;
};

Assuming a 64-bit architecture where int is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes, the size of this struct would be 24 bytes (1 byte for char + 3 bytes of padding, 4 bytes for int, and 8 bytes for double). This is because the int member must be aligned on a 4-byte boundary, so there are 3 bytes of padding added after the char member to achieve this alignment.

Padding can also occur within arrays and structures of arrays. For example, if we have an array of 32-bit integers, and we want to access the second element of the array, we need to start at an address that is a multiple of 4 bytes. If the first element is not properly aligned, the CPU may have to read two memory accesses to retrieve the data, which can cause a performance penalty.

Padding is usually inserted automatically by the compiler or runtime system, so it is typically not something that developers need to worry about in most high-level programming languages. However, it is important to be aware of padding and alignment requirements when working with low-level programming languages or when optimizing performance-critical code.

### Finding memory address

Python:

x = 42
print(id(x))  # prints something like 140597269098400

C#;

int x = 42;
IntPtr address = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(Marshal.SizeOf(x));

Marshal.StructureToPtr(x, address, false);
Console.WriteLine(address);


c++

int x = 42;
int* address = &x;
cout << address << endl;

Javascript:
let x = { foo: 42 };
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(x));

## Data structures internals

### Hash functions

The djb2 function is a simple hash function that was created by Dan Bernstein. It takes a string as input and produces a hash value as output. The hash value is a 32-bit unsigned integer that is used to identify the string.

Here's the implementation of the djb2 function in Python:

def djb2(string):
    hash_value = 5381
    for char in string:
        hash_value = ((hash_value << 5) + hash_value) + ord(char)
    return hash_value & 0xFFFFFFFF


Let's break down how this function works:

The function takes a string as input.

It initializes a hash value to 5381.

It loops through each character in the string and updates the hash value based on the ASCII value of the character. Specifically, it performs the following operation:

hash_value = ((hash_value << 5) + hash_value) + ord(char)

This operation left-shifts the hash value by 5 bits (multiplies by 32), adds the original hash value to it, and adds the ASCII value of the current character to it.

Finally, the function returns the hash value modulo 2^32, which ensures that the hash value is a 32-bit unsigned integer.

Here's an example of how to use the djb2 function:

>>> string = "hello, world!"
>>> hash_value = djb2(string)
>>> print(hash_value)
1540932062

C++:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

unsigned long djb2(std::string str) {
    unsigned long hash = 5381;
    int c;

    for (char& c : str) {
        hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + c;
    }

    return hash;
}

int main() {
    std::string string = "hello, world!";
    unsigned long hash_value = djb2(string);
    std::cout << hash_value << std::endl;
    return 0;
}


JS:

function djb2(str) {
    let hash = 5381;

    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + str.charCodeAt(i);
    }

    return hash;
}

let string = "hello, world!";
let hash_value = djb2(string);
console.log(hash_value);

C#:

using System;

class Program
{
    static uint djb2(string str)
    {
        uint hash = 5381;

        foreach (char c in str)
        {
            hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + c;
        }

        return hash;
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string str = "hello, world!";
        uint hash_value = djb2(str);
        Console.WriteLine(hash_value);
    }
}


### Hashing Collision Solutions

1. Open addressing: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the hash table and places the item there. The slots are searched in a fixed sequence, which can be either linear or quadratic. This technique is called "open addressing" because it does not require the use of a separate data structure to store collided items. However, as the table fills up, the number of collisions can increase significantly, which can negatively impact performance.

1.1 Linear probing: In linear probing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the hash table by probing the slots one by one until it finds an empty slot. The slots are probed in a linear sequence, which means that the algorithm checks the next slot after the current slot until it finds an empty slot. This technique is easy to implement and can have good cache performance, but it can suffer from clustering, where items tend to cluster together in certain parts of the table.


1.2 Double hashing: In double hashing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm uses a secondary hash function to calculate an offset value that is added to the original hash index to find the next available slot. The offset value is calculated using a different hash function than the primary hash function, which helps to reduce clustering and improve performance. However, finding a good secondary hash function can be difficult, and the technique can still suffer from clustering if the hash functions are poorly chosen.

2. Chaining

Chaining is another technique for resolving collisions in hash tables. In chaining, instead of storing items directly in the hash table, we use a linked list to store all the items that hash to the same index. When a collision occurs, the algorithm simply adds the new item to the end of the linked list at the appropriate index.

The advantage of chaining is that it can handle a large number of collisions without degrading performance. The linked list provides a dynamic structure that can grow as needed to accommodate more items, without requiring any additional memory allocation. Additionally, because each slot in the table only needs to store a reference to the head of the linked list, the memory requirements for the hash table can be smaller than other techniques that require a slot for each item.

However, chaining can suffer from poor cache performance, because the items that hash to the same index may not be contiguous in memory. This can lead to a high number of cache misses and degrade performance.
